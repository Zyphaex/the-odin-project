      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar
        in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy
        foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away
        from the sides of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
      <li>
        Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in
        garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled
        again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic
        in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an
        oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to
        puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn
        dough over using two spatulas.
      </li>
      <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust.</li>
      <li>
        Top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes,
        olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set
        aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.
      </li>
